Hi Vince,
Thank you for the follow-up. To clarify our implementation:

Method Used: We deployed a custom PowerShell script that sends metrics to Datadog via the Custom Metrics API (POST to /api/v1/series endpoint).
Metric Names: Metrics are submitted as custom metrics with the prefix custom.databricks.* (e.g., custom.databricks.cluster.cpu, custom.databricks.cluster.memory, custom.databricks.jobs.failed).
API Response: The script receives HTTP 202 responses confirming the metrics are accepted by the API.
Issue: Despite successful API submissions, the metrics are not appearing in the Datadog UI under Metrics Explorer or in our monitors.

We did NOT use the official Databricks integration tile. We are sending custom metrics via the API.
Can you confirm:

Where custom metrics (custom.*) should appear in the UI?
Is there a delay before custom metrics become queryable?
Are there any additional steps needed to make custom metrics visible?

Thank you,
Syed
