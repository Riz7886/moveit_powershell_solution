Tell Tony This:

"I built a SQL database auto-optimizer that not only identifies savings but actually implements them safely. It has preview mode, confirmation prompts, and a rollback script. I can show you a preview first, then apply the changes after your approval. Based on the audit, we could save around $60K/year."
