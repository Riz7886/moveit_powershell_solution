Hi Vince,

I ran the script again just now. Here's what I'm seeing:

SCRIPT OUTPUT:
✅ HTTP Status: 202
✅ Response: {"errors":[]}
✅ Cluster is RUNNING (State: RUNNING, CPU: 22%, Memory: 38%)

METRICS SENT IN SAME API CALL:
- custom.databricks.cluster.status (value: 1) 
- custom.databricks.cluster.cpu (value: 22)
- custom.databricks.cluster.memory (value: 38)
- custom.databricks.cluster.dbu_usage (value: 13)

WHAT'S HAPPENING:
✅ custom.databricks.cluster.status - SHOWS in Metrics Summary
❌ custom.databricks.cluster.cpu - NOT showing anywhere
❌ custom.databricks.cluster.memory - NOT showing anywhere
❌ custom.databricks.cluster.dbu_usage - NOT showing anywhere

All 4 metrics are sent in the SAME payload, same format, same API call.
Why is only "status" being indexed but not cpu/memory/dbu?

Is there a filter or restriction blocking these specific metric names?

Thanks,
Syed
