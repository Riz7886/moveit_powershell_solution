MFA Enforcement Script (MFA-Enforcement-GOD-Script.ps1)
Will it break anything? No — if you run it correctly.
Here's why it's safe:

Option 1 (-AuditOnly) — purely read-only. It scans users, checks MFA registration status, maps admin roles, and generates the HTML report. Changes absolutely nothing. Zero risk.
Option 2 (-EnforceAll) — creates the 5 Conditional Access policies in Report-Only mode, not Enabled. That means they log what would happen but don't actually enforce anything yet. It also creates the break-glass accounts. Low risk — nothing gets blocked.
Option 5 — this is the one that flips policies from Report-Only to Enabled. This is where users without MFA registered would get prompted. This is the only step that could "break" someone's access if they haven't registered MFA yet.

Safe approach: Run Option 1 first (audit), review the report, then Option 2 (deploy in report-only), then Option 5 only when you're ready to go live before Feb 9.

Databricks Task Scheduler Scripts
There are two pieces here:

Setup-ScheduledTask.ps1 — Creates a Windows Task Scheduler job that runs the Databricks-Datadog monitoring script every 60 seconds. Won't break anything — it just sends metrics to Datadog. Read-only against Databricks.
install_autoscaler_task.ps1 (the auto-scaler) — This one does make changes — it scales Databricks warehouses up/down based on latency and queue depth. However, it has safety guards built in: cooldown timers (10 min between actions), max 3 scale-ups per hour, and a size ladder so it only steps one size at a time. Low risk but not zero — it modifies warehouse cluster sizes when thresholds are hit.

Run order reminder from our last conversation:

master_operations.ps1 (dry run first — creates service account)
