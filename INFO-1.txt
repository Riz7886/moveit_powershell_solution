# All we do is CALL this API to GET data:
GET /api/2.0/clusters/list

# Then SEND to Datadog - that's it!
```

**We never WRITE anything to Databricks!**

Hi Shaun,

The Datadog monitoring script I created is READ-ONLY - it only calls the 
Databricks API to get cluster info and sends it to Datadog. It does NOT:

- Install any init scripts
- Modify cluster configurations  
- Change cluster names
- Affect cluster startup/shutdown

The init script errors you're seeing are from something else - possibly 
someone added init scripts directly to the cluster configuration in 
Databricks. Can you check who modified the cluster settings recently?
