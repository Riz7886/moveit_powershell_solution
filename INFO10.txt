This is perfect - Serv-U solves the user access problem completely. Web links, no installs, already working.
The only gap is the retention policy on the backend blob storage. Right now it's 7 days, QA needs 90 days.
Here's what we actually need to do:

Keep Serv-U - it's already the right solution for user access
Extend blob retention from 7 days to 90 days
Done - no new infrastructure needed

Can we confirm which storage account Serv-U/MoveIT writes to? I can update the lifecycle policy from 7 to 90 days in about 5 minutes.
If we want to keep operational data at 7 days but give QA 90 days, we can create a second container with separate retention - MoveIT can copy to both.
