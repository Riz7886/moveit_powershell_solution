Hey Tony, here's the breakdown of next steps for the AtRisk users:

1. Investigate the risk detections — We need to go into Entra ID > Identity Protection > Risky Users and review what triggered the risk for each user (leaked credentials, anomalous sign-ins, malware-linked IPs, etc.).

2. Triage by risk level — High-risk users need immediate action. Medium-risk users we can review case by case.

3. Remediate the flagged users:
   - Force password reset for users with credential-based risks
   - Revoke active sessions/refresh tokens
   - Confirm compromise or dismiss the risk after investigation
   - Ensure MFA is enforced for these users via Conditional Access if it isn't already

4. Set up automated remediation — We should have a Conditional Access policy that automatically requires password change + MFA when user risk hits High. That way we're not doing this manually every time.

5. I'll filter out disabled accounts from the report so we're only looking at active users that need action.

I can pull together the filtered list of active AtRisk users and we can divide up who reaches out to which users. Let me know if you want to set up a quick call to go through the list.
