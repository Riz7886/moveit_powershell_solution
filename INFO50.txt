Hi Tony,

Sorry about the Excel file — it may not have exported correctly. The HTML report is the main deliverable. Here's what everything means:

WHAT THE REPORT SHOWS:
This is an MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) audit of every user in our tenant. It scans who has MFA registered and who doesn't.

WHAT THE WARNINGS MEAN:
- WARN = That user does NOT have MFA set up yet
- State: atRisk = They are at risk because if MFA gets enforced (Microsoft deadline is Feb 9), they will be prompted to register MFA at their next login or could get locked out
- Risk: low = Regular user account (not an admin)
- Risk: medium = User with some elevated access

THE USERS LISTED:
Yes — every user showing WARN/atRisk needs to set up MFA before Feb 9. This includes:
- ES Test, Kate Garcia, Aaron Mease, Alexis King, Maryfin Skye, Austin Hunter, Sheraz Khalid, Alana Hartley, Joe Armstrong, Garri Jackson-Mace, Call Center Library, Samantha Heinrich, SharePoint Service, Planful Integrations, Rafael Pacheco, Siboney Pena, Brett Ehrhardt, Kathryn Matlock, Isamar Sosa, Ian Quick

Some of these are service accounts (Call Center Library, SharePoint Service, Planful Integrations) — those will need to be handled differently since they can't do interactive MFA. We can exclude them via Conditional Access policy.

WHAT "EVERYTHING AT 0" MEANS:
The scores at 0 mean those users have ZERO MFA methods registered — no Authenticator app, no phone number, no FIDO key, nothing. They are completely unprotected.

WHAT WE NEED TO DO:
1. Notify all users on the list to register MFA (Microsoft Authenticator is easiest)
2. Exclude service accounts from MFA enforcement via Conditional Access
3. Enforce MFA policies before Feb 9 deadline

I can send out an email to all affected users with step-by-step instructions to set up MFA if you'd like.

Let me know how you want to proceed.
