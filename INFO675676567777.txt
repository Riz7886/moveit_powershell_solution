Hi Tony,

I can handle this. UniFi OS updates are straightforward - I've done these before.

For the UDM Pro going from 4.4.6 to 5.0.12:

BEFORE UPDATING:
- Backup current config (Settings > System > Backup)
- Check if any critical changes in 5.0.12 release notes
- Schedule during maintenance window (brief downtime expected)

THE UPDATE:
- Click "Install now" 
- Update takes ~5-10 minutes
- Controller will reboot
- Network will have ~2-3 min downtime during reboot

AFTER UPDATE:
- Verify all devices reconnect
- Check controller shows all APs/switches online
- Test connectivity

Best practice: Do this during off-hours (evening/weekend) to minimize 
impact. I can handle it if you want, or walk someone through it.

Let me know when you want to schedule it!
