Good discussion team. Here's my recommendation based on Microsoft Intune best practices:

**Current Risk:** Using both "All Users" AND "All Devices" together creates duplicate processing and potential conflicts. Microsoft explicitly recommends NOT mixing user and device groups in a single assignment.

**Best Practice Approach:**

📱 **Device Groups** - Use for:
- Required/core apps (must be on every device)
- Security tools, VPN, endpoint protection
- Apps that need to work before user signs in

👤 **User Groups** - Use for:
- Apps that follow the user across devices
- "Available" apps in Company Portal
- User-specific software

**Recommended Structure:**
1. Create `SG-Intune-ManagedDevices` (Dynamic)
2. Create `SG-Intune-LicensedUsers` (Dynamic)  
3. Create `SG-Intune-Pilot` (for testing)

**Deployment Flow:**
Pilot Group → 48hr validation → Production Group

**My Vote:** Standardize on Device Groups for Required apps, User Groups for Available apps. Never both for the same deployment.

Happy to document this as our team standard if we agree on the approach.
