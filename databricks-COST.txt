Subject: Databricks Cost Analysis - Runaway Scenarios & SQL Warehouse Upgrade Costs

Hi Preyash,

Attached is the complete Databricks cost analysis you requested.

The report covers:
- Current baseline costs ($1,480/month)
- Minimum scenario with optimizations ($1,080/month - saves $400)
- Maximum runaway scenario ($9,450/month - potential $7,970 increase)
- SQL Warehouse upgrade costs (one tier higher):
  - X-Small: +$250/month
  - Small: +$550/month
- SQL performance optimization recommendations (zero cost)

Key Recommendation:
Start with the free optimizations in Section 5 (can achieve 2-5x faster queries). Only upgrade SQL Warehouse tier if performance is still slow after 2-4 weeks.

Please review the attached HTML report. Let me know if you need any clarification or have questions.

Thanks,
