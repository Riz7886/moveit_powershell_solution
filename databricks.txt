Hey Preyash,

Here's the complete runaway cost analysis + SQL performance doc you requested.

KEY FINDINGS:
- Current: $1,480/month
- Best case (optimized): $1,080/month (-$400)
- Worst case (runaway): $9,450/month (+$7,970!)

SQL WAREHOUSE UPGRADE COSTS:
- One tier up (X-Small): +$250/month
- Two tiers up (Small): +$550/month

RECOMMENDATION:
1. Start with FREE optimizations (can get 2-5x faster queries)
2. Monitor for 2-4 weeks
3. Only upgrade tier if still slow after optimizations

Doc has all the details, cost breakdowns, and step-by-step fixes for SQL performance.

Let me know if you need anything else!
