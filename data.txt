Hi Vince,

I tested with /api/v2/series as you suggested. Results:

✅ HTTP Status: 202
✅ Response: {"errors":[]}
❌ Metrics still NOT visible in Metrics Explorer

Script output shows:
- Endpoint: https://api.us3.datadoghq.com/api/v2/series
- Metrics sent: 5 (custom.databricks.cluster.status, cpu, memory, dbu_usage)
- Waited 5+ minutes after submission

Since both V1 and V2 return success (202) but metrics don't appear, 
could you please check on the backend:

1. Are custom metrics enabled for our organization?
2. Is there an ingestion filter blocking "custom.*" namespace?
3. Are metrics being received but not indexed?
4. Is there a quota or plan limitation we're hitting?

Our organization is on site us3.datadoghq.com.

Happy to join a call if that would help troubleshoot faster.

Thanks,
Syed
