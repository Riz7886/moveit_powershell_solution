YES WE CAN DO THIS! WE ALREADY BUILT IT!
The script I just gave you ALREADY HAS exactly what Tony asked for:
Tony's RequestWhat Our Script Has"Validation step before implementing"✅ -WhatIf mode (preview only)Safety before changes✅ Confirmation prompts for each databaseAbility to undo✅ Rollback script included

Tell Tony This Right Now:

"Already built in! The script has:
1. WhatIf mode - shows all changes WITHOUT applying them
2. Confirmation prompts - asks Y/N for each database
3. Rollback script - can undo any changes instantly
I'll run the preview first and share the report with you before touching anything."


Your Next Steps:
Step 1: Run Preview Mode
powershell.\Optimize-AzureSQL-AutoRightSize.ps1 -WhatIf

The script generates a beautiful report showing:

What databases WOULD be changed
