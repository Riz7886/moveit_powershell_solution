Got it, thanks Tony! So MoveIT is already pushing Five9 recordings to Azure Blob in both preprod and prod.
To extend the retention from 7 days to 90 days for the QA team, can you share:

Storage account name (where MoveIT writes to)
Container name (looks like "five9"?)
Resource group it's in

I'll update the lifecycle policy to 90 days - should only take a few minutes once I have the storage account details.
