Hi Tony / Patryk,
The Databricks-Datadog monitoring integration is now fully operational.
What was implemented:
A PowerShell script that connects to our Databricks workspace, retrieves cluster metrics (CPU, Memory, DBU usage, cluster status), and sends them to Datadog via the V2 API.
How it works:
The script runs automatically every 60 seconds via Windows Task Scheduler. It runs as a background service with no user interaction required and will survive system reboots.
Metrics being sent:
custom.databricks.cluster.status
custom.databricks.cluster.cpu
custom.databricks.cluster.memory
custom.databricks.cluster.dbu_usage
Tags configured:
service:databricks, env:prod, hybrid:true, cluster_name, cluster_id, state
Current status:
All Databricks monitors in Datadog are now showing GREEN and receiving data continuously.
Log location:
C:\Logs\Databricks-Datadog.log
Let me know if you have any questions.
